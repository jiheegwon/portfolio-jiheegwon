It is also designed with functions, which make the interaction with professors and other students possible to get a maximum educational effect. It is optimized in the area of natural science, especially gut microbiota, through simplified visualization for better understanding than photorealistic. This visualization concept is proper for details of contents and complexity with animation as a blackboard technique, which is considered the cognitive perception for effective learning. Via the usage of this platform, students can study higher educational content at any time and in any place in their own tempo without losing the interactivity of conventional education. Professors or educators can spend more time to support smaller groups of students or individual questions by saving the time that was spent for giving conventional repetitive lessons. UI/UX design in the platform intends the needs of students by learning and engagement in education when the platform must cover the analog education in the case of physical distancing like a Covid-19 crisis.",

In addition, it suggests many recipes, which are based on the last few scanned ingredients. Through a questioner, the users individual health requirements and personal diet goals are defined. These goals are always in the foreground and can be updated in the personal profile. Next to the personal profile, infographics compiled by the users statistics help keep track of relevant information. Here the user can also find a gallery with an overview of all recorded ingredients. The project was created in the winter semester 2017/18 at the Muthesius University of fine arts and design as part of the semester project „Augmented Utopia“ Nutreat is team project by Jade Deazle, Jihee Gwon, Johannes Longardt und Daniel Schaber.",
